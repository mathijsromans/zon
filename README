For building and running zon, you need:

c++ compiler ( e.g. g++ )
cmake
allegro ( e.g. liballegro4.2-dev )
boost ( including boost_signal library, e.g. libboost-dev )

Build steps:
cmake .
make

Run step:
./zon

Alternative: building in a separate directory:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd ..
build/zon
